Star Atlas is proud to announce that it has selected Solana as the protocol to build out its blockchain driven massively-multi player metaverse. Star Atlas is developing a unique gaming experience by combining blockchain mechanics with traditional game mechanics. Solana launched the first ever “web-scale blockchain” in 2019 making it the only blockchain solution capable of hosting applications with the computational bandwidth akin to the modern internet, presenting the capability to power decentralized versions of Nasdaq, Facebook, Twitter and all other existing blockchains. Star Atlas fully embraces the potential of decentralized self-sovereign ownership of assets permitted through the implementation of blockchain into asset ownership and NFT marketplaces.
